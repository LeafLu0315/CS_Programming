  Sticks</A>&nbsp;</FONT></B></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></H1>You have to cut a 
wood stick into pieces. The most affordable company, The Analog Cutting 
Machinery, Inc. (ACM), charges money according to the length of the stick being 
cut. Their procedure of work requires that they only make one cut at a time. 
<P>It is easy to notice that different selections in the order of cutting can 
led to different prices. For example, consider a stick of length 10 meters that 
has to be cut at 2, 4 and 7 meters from one end. There are several choices. One 
can be cutting first at 2, then at 4, then at 7. This leads to a price of 10 + 8 
+ 6 = 24 because the first stick was of 10 meters, the resulting of 8 and the 
last one of 6. Another choice could be cutting at 4, then at 2, then at 7. This 
would lead to a price of 10 + 4 + 6 = 20, which is a better price. 
<P>Your boss trusts your computer abilities to find out the minimum cost for 
cutting a given stick.

name=SECTION0001001000000000000000>Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT> </H2>The input will 
consist of several input cases. The first line of each test case will contain a 
positive number <I>l</I> that represents the length of the stick to be cut. You 
can assume <I>l</I> &lt; 1000. The next line will contain the number <I>n</I> 
(<I>n</I> &lt; 50) of cuts to be made. 
<P>The next line consists of <I>n</I> positive numbers 
<I>c</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> ( <!-- MATH: $0 < c_i < l$ -->0 &lt; 
<I>c</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> &lt; <I>l</I>) representing the places where the 
cuts have to be done, given in strictly increasing order. 
<P>An input case with <I>l</I> = 0 will represent the end of the input.

print the cost of the optimal solution of the cutting problem, that is the 
minimum cost of cutting the given stick. Format the output as shown below.
